# CreativeCoding_Project_1
This is my project 1 for Creative Coding.
The adjective that my code is based off of is "psychedelic."

In the project itself, you can click the mouse in any of the four corners of the window for a different effect depending on where you click.
You can press and hold the R key to reverse the iteration order of the circles, creating a different pattern for as long as you hold down the button.
You can press and hold the N key to remove all but the largest center circle, creating a different pattern for as long as you hold down the button.
