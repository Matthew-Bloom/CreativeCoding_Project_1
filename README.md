# CreativeCoding_Project_1
This is my project 1 for Creative Coding.
The adjective that my code is based off of is "psychedelic."

In the project itself, you can press certain keys to alter the existing default pattern, allowing for a different effect depending on what you click. 
You can press and hold the S key to remove all but the largest center circle, creating a different pattern for as long as you hold down the button.
You can press and hold the D key to remove all but the four circles in the corners of the page and add a background behind them, creating a different pattern for as long as you hold down the button.
You can press and hold the F key to highlight the top right and bottom left circles and add a background behind them, creating a different pattern for as long as you hold down the button.
You can press and hold the G key to highlight the top left and bottom right circles and add a background behind them, creating a different pattern for as long as you hold down the button.
You can press and hold the R key to reverse the iteration order of the circles, creating a different pattern for as long as you hold down the button.
You can press and hold the left arrow key to highlight the left three circles and add a background behind them, creating a different pattern for as long as you hold down the button.
You can press and hold the right arrow key to highlight the right three circles and add a background behind them, creating a different pattern for as long as you hold down the button.
You can press and hold the up arrow key to highlight the top three circles and add a background behind them, creating a different pattern for as long as you hold down the button.
You can press and hold the down arrow key to highlight the bottom three circles and add a background behind them, creating a different pattern for as long as you hold down the button.
Once a key is pressed, you can maintain the new pattern for as long as you like by holding down the key. Releasing the key will restore the default pattern.
